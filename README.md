Sentiment Bayes is a pocket-sized Naive Bayes lab that moonlights as a sentiment detective, clipping happy/angsty vibes with embarrassingly simple math.

- Ships with a ready-to-train Go classifier, CSV loader, evaluation mode, and a `/classify` HTTP endpoint so you can go from dataset to demo to deployment before your coffee cools.
- Supports JSON snapshots to freeze brainy models in amber and revive them later without retraining.
- Includes a playful demo dataset plus CLI flags for real-world corpora when you’re ready to graduate from toy drama to production-grade angst.
